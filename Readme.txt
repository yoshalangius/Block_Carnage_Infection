As unfortunate as i am, i must give you the sad news that this reposetory is empty.
While trying to publish Block Carnage Infection to GitHub something went wrong.
And since i had no prior versions of the game it is officialy gone.
The .exe is still playable although bugged because of the version diffrence.
It was mad in unity 4 and i made the build in unity 5.
I am Sorry to bring you this sad news, i will rebuild the game.
Again Sorry for the inconvenience.
